# dejarik-online
(future) online Dejarik simulator with multiple rulesets

This project intends to be an online simulator for numerous variations, both official and fan-made, of the in-universe _Star Wars_ game Dejarik, also known as Holochess.

[Blake Whitlow's document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iw3g_udV7W-5XfNFlcppRwCMOhFag1lTcSPc9ygdseY/edit) has been a valuable source of information for this project.
